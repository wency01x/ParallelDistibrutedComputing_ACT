# Laboratory 4: Pageant Tabulation Benchmark (Sequential vs. Parallel)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the performance differences between sequential and parallel processing in Python. The script simulates a pageant tabulation system where 50 candidates receive scores from 5 different judges. 

By comparing a standard `for` loop (sequential processing) against Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` (parallel processing), the program measures the execution time of both methods and calculates the overall speedup ratio gained from concurrent execution.
